        <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm <strong>Lakshita Kalra</strong>, a passionate and curious first-year B.Tech Computer Science student.
    Ever since I discovered the world of technology, I’ve been deeply fascinated 
    by how it can be used to innovate, solve problems, and bring creative ideas to life.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey into tech started with programming in <strong>C++</strong>, where I learned the power of logic and problem solving. 
    From there, my interests expanded into <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> — the idea of machines that can think, learn, 
    and adapt just like us absolutely excites me. I'm currently exploring how AI can be used in real-world applications, and it's 
    a space I hope to contribute to in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I’m not just about code. I’m also a visual thinker and a storyteller. I enjoy <strong>video editing</strong>, 
    <strong>poster designing</strong>, and creating engaging content that communicates ideas clearly and beautifully. 
    Tools like Canva allow me to blend creativity with clarity — a balance I try to bring into everything I do.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've had the chance to collaborate on exciting projects like <strong>InStock</strong>, a web-based inventory management system 
    built and working as a team member on real-world projects has helped me grow not just technically 
    but also as a collaborator and communicator.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of academics and tech, I enjoy spending time thinking deeply, exploring new topics in AI, and always finding new ways 
    to learn something useful. Whether it’s writing code, designing visuals, or brainstorming new ideas — I bring energy, curiosity, 
    and a hunger to keep improving.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe the best creations come from combining logic with imagination. I'm on a mission to keep growing, building, and 
    creating things that make a difference.
  </p>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">
    “The best way to predict the future is to create it.” — Let’s create something amazing!
